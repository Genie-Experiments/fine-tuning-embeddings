First, b eginning in the early \n1990\u2019s academics identified networks as the quintessential organizational form of the post -\nindustrial, information society (Castells, 1996 ; Monge & Fulk, 1999 ; Mulgan , 1991 ; C. \nStohl, 1995 ). The turbulence, volatility, and uncertainty  associated with globalization require \norganizational responsiveness, adaptation, and efficiency in communication systems that are \nnot found in traditional hierarchical organizations but are made possible in global network \nforms (Monge, 1995).  Across disciplines, most the ories of globalization  include a strong \n                                                 \n1 Ms. Sterling argued that there existed an international network of terrorists within whose cent er one f ound  \na Palestinian connection and a Russian patron, with, quite often, a Cuban cutout providing the shield for \ndirect Russian participation. She argued that the Soviet Union had placed a loaded gun of the world table \nand benefited each time someone  picked it up and used it.   Secretary of State Alexander Haig and the \nReagan administration went further and suggested that the Russians were behind it all.  The administration \nwas unable to convince its own intelligence agencies (or those of its allies) to support its view of the Soviet \nrole and was not able to provide public evidence for the existence of such an actual network (Taubman, \n1981:10; Pear, 1981:8; Miller, 1981:4).  In one of the more celebrated instances of \u201cblowback,\u201d William \nCasey, Director  of the CIA, confronted his analysts when they refused to confirm that the Soviets were \nbehind it all. \"Read Claire Sterling's book and forget this mush.

Thus, while there is no doubt that there was Soviet \nsupport for the aims  of many of the groups that were under suspicion, and that many members of those \ngroups had passed through either the Soviet Union or one of its client states, there was also no clear \nnetwork chart that distinguished the types of clear links, membership an d type of network.",

Small world networks of all types fall somewhere b etween randomness and regular \u201clatticed\u201d \nnetworks,  having a high degree of clustering (like regular networks) and shorter degrees of \nseparation  (like random networks)  \n \nb. Relatively minor changes in the connectivity of a network can have dramatic changes on  the global \nstructure of a network.  \n \nc. With their relatively small degree of separation between any two nodes, small world networks \nfacilitate the efficient transmission of information or other resources without having to overload the \nnetwork with too many r edundant links.  \n \nd. Netw orks are governed by two laws: growth and preferential attachment.  Preferential attachment \nsuggests that linking is not random;  certain links have qualities (e.g. popularity, more links than \nanyone else, and greater  resources) that at tract other links. Furthermore, real networks tend to grow \none link at a time. The number of links never stabilizes or remains fixed.  \n \ne. More complex networks tend to fluctuate less and are more stable than simple networks.  Networks \nwhich exhibit the small  world architecture can have a significant fraction of nodes removed \nrandomly without breaking apart. In a random network if the number of links removed reaches a \ncritical point , the system abruptly breaks into isolated tiny unconnected islands. Even when 80% of \nnodes are randomly removed in scale free networks,  the remaining 20% still hang together. This \nrobustness, resilience to errors against failures , is a property not shared by random networks.  \n \nf. The source of topological  robustness is the existence of  the hubs, the few highly connected nodes \nthat keep the scale free network together.  Failures disproportionately affect small nodes. The \naccidental removal of a single hub will not be fatal since the continuous hierarchy of several large \nhubs will maintai n the network\u2019s integrity.  \n \ng. Random networks, despite their redundancy , fall apart quite quickly in the f ace of an \nuncoordinated attack, whereas the small world architecture makes a network resilient against \nrandom failure or unsophisticated attack.  \n \nh. The very feature that \u201c makes a small world network safe from random failure could be its Achilles \nheel in the face of an intelligent assault\u201d (Buchanan , 2002 , p. 132). Under coordinated attack, the \nrandom network has the advantage;  a small world network is ext remely vulnerable.  \u201cDisable a few \nof the hubs and a scale fr ee network will fall to pieces \u201d (Barabasi, 2002, p. 118).  \n \ni. Building redundancy into a network is not nearly enough ; more subtle features of the architecture \ncan have important effects.",

The history of events after September 11, 2001 \nillustrate s that we do not yet fully understand the interplay between network robustness \nand vulnerability . Network organization s may be constituted by very different \ncommunicative relati onships  within and across cells  (e.g. scale free or random) and these \nemergent structures have both pragmatic and policy implications . For example, Arquilla, \nRonfeldt and Zanini (1999) caution  \nIt is important to avoid equating the bin Laden network solely with bin Laden.  He \nrepresents a key node in the Arab Afghan terror network, but there should be no \nillusion about the likely effect on the network of actions taken to neutralize him.  \nThe net work  conducts many operations without his involvement, leadershi p, or \nfinancing \u2013 and will continue to be able to do so s hould he be killed or captured \n(p.63) . \nA careful analysis of the structures that emerge from the aggregated data of various \nsources  (see Krebs, 2002  for an example) would clearly help us envision mor e \nrealistically what might be the best solutions for network disruption.  Carley, Lee and \nKrackhardt (200 2), for example, utilize computational analysis to illustrate the  value  of \nsimulated models which combine cognitively realistic  agents, social network data, and \ntheoretically -informed network rules  to address the issue of network destabilization. \nTheir results  reveal  that the removal of the \u201cleader/central agent\u201d in both  hierarchical  and \ndistributed decentralized  network s may  have unanticipated  effects.

Consider \nethnically -based political organiza tions such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Basque  ETA . \nFrom a communicative network perspective these terrorist organizations enact a cell \nstructure composed primarily of homophilous links (e.g. clan or ethnic group  members ). \nAlthough different from typic al cell structures insofar as 1) connections with \u201coutsiders\u201d \nexpose the organization to the threat of infiltration and arrest or death, 2) links must act \nwith stealth and secrecy, and 3) in many , but not all locations the very organization / \nnetwork  is illegal  and must therefore be clandestine , these structures provide histo ric \nillustrations  of the network principles  found in Table 1 . Constructed as typical cell \norganizations, growth and preferential attachment are turned inward.  Conspirators do not \nform many n ew ties outside the network and often minimize the activation of existing ties \ninside the network.  Strong ties, which remain mostly dormant and hidden, were \nfrequently formed years ago in school and training camps, and keep the cell \ninterconnected.   Many  such organizations  also recruit  their members only from a known \nand rather closed circle of potential participants, for example the family or clan and thus \nrely on kinship ties to provide trust  (see Norton, 1988, p. 3 ).

As long as the conditions fo r the ideological \nposition remain, however, new members continually join and though the entire \norganization may be in a difficult position to coordinate and carry out planned activity, \nindividuals may act independently in accordance with the organizational  mission.  \nThere are significant policy implication s embedded within this theoretical \nnetwork understanding  of terrorist organizing .

As Ross and Gurr (1989 ) discuss  there are four general kinds of \nconditions which can contribute to the decline of political terrorism : preemption, \ndeterrence, burnout, and backlash.  \u201cPreemption and deterrence  are counterterrorist \npolicies and actions which can reduce or eliminate the terrorists\u2019 coercive capabilities.  \nBurnout and backlash  are general conditions which reduce the political cap abilities of \ngroups using te rrorism \u201d (p. 408).   \nBurnout  refers to members \u2019 declining commitment to the group and its purposes, \nan effect more frequent ly seen and pronounced in ideological movements.

Its goals are to establish an Islamic state in Lebano n \nand to liberate all occupied Arab lands including Jerusalem.  While it has engaged in actions that have been \nfar more deadly than Fatah or the IRA, it also uses its terrorism in a coercive bargaining approach. In \naddition, during the period of negotiatio n between PLO and Israel very different goals have been pursued \nby Fatah under Arafat and Hezbollah (and Hamas) which reject the political strategy and, in fact, have not \nonly targeted Israel but have engaged in a struggle against Arafat as well for pursui ng an agreement \n(however poorly or fitfully that is judged from within Israel or elsewhere).  This is not noted by Arquilla et \nal. \n \nThese groups are all very different from Al Qaeda, whose \u201cmain mission is the overthrow of the godless \nregimes and their rep lacement with an Islamic regime\u201d in that their political programs are confined to \n\u201cGreater Palestine,\u201d or Lebanon and Palestine.   However, for Al Qaeda to achieve its goals it is necessary \nfor the populations of the Muslim states to rise up against their regimes and thus they may make common \ncause with groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah. We may therefore conclude that in part attacking the \nUnited States (both within our borders and around the world) demonstrates that Al Qaeda can inflict great \npain on the U.S. and destroy the veneer of invincibility of the world\u2019s sole remaining superpower.  Al \nQaeda\u2019s goals are thus more global than local and that combined with the belief that the United States is the \nhub of evil in the world allows and justifies the targe ting and killing of large numbers.  Al Qaeda is thus in \na war against the United States and its allies in the Middle East (all of the \u201cconservative\u201d Arab regimes \n(e.g.  Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States).  It is a war in which there is no clear bargaining point \nand thus hierarchy and control of the various cells are not necessary.",

These \nmultiple logics are embedded in operating routines, performance programs, \nbureaucratic politics , norms, cultur al beliefs and social networks.   \n By linking organizations as networks with a focus on the communicative \nconstitution of organization we will be better able to understand the role of information \ntechnology.  \nCONCLUSION  \n \nJohn Naisbitt (1990) c ertainly was prescient when he suggested the shift \nfrom hierarchy to networks as one of the ten megatrends shaping the future. Since \nthat time, network  has emerged as 1) a popular descriptor for many forms  of \nsocial organizing both benign and malignant, 2)  a verb designating  strategic and \nwell positioned communication, and  3) the focus of a great deal of theoretical and \nempirical research in the physical and biological sciences, engineering, and social \nscience.  As the unfolding of the discourse after Sept ember 11, 2001 clearly \ndemonstrates networks are no longer conceived as residing within  traditional \nbureaucratic organizations but rather as representing \u201c organization \u201d writ large . \nWe have suggested throu ghout this essay that these forms of organizing require \nnew theoretical approaches and methods rooted in the constitutive communicative \nfeatures of organizing.   \n                                                                                                                                                 \nAs suggested in the text above, the distributed network organization is useful to prevent detection and \noperates well when all goals are previously declared but it is n ot necessarily useful for negotiation of \npolitical processes because there is no \u201cleadership.\u2019",
        "f74b20ff-6dfe-4522-9fb9-db3a9fceb99e": "40  Whether terrorist networks will conform to the principles and processes that their \ntopology and structure suggest remains to be seen.  As social scientists we  are somewhat \nskeptical of the first part of Buchanan\u2019s (2003) claim, but in complete agreement with the \nsecond. The more we can understand network forms of organizing, the richer our \nanalyses will become . \nIn reality, terrorist networks obey th e rigid laws that determine their typology, \nstructure and therefore their ability to function. They exploit all the advantages of \nself organized networks, including flexibility and tolerance to internal failures. \nUnfamiliarity with this new order and a lac k of language for formularizing our \nexperience are perhaps our most deadly enemies (Buchanan, 2002,   p. 223) . \n \nFurthermore, t here is no reason to believe that terrorist organization s will not \ncapitalize on the advantages of self organized networks.  As Ba rabasi  (2002 , p. 225) \nwrites , \nThe goal before us is to understand complexity. To achieve that we must move \nbeyond structure and topology and start focusing on the dynamics that take place \nalong the links. Networks are only the skeleton of complexity, the h ighways for the \nvarious processes that make our world hum . \n \nClearly, just understanding the communicative composition, emergence and \npersistent enactment of terrorist networks will not solve the problems facing us today.  The \nUnited States along with many other countries, the  United Nations, and additional \ngovernmental and non governmental associations  throughout the world must join together \nand act cooperatively to alter the very conditions that give rise to the desperation that has \nemboldened terrorist organizing and deter and protect against future attacks.  We also \nstrongly believe, however, that a better understanding of the communicative foundations of \norganizing, along with careful and detailed examination and consideration of the \nmultidimensional c auses that arise in different contexts throughout the world will enable us \nto mobilize individuals, groups, publics, and nation states in ways that will be better",

Undoubtedly , understanding the emergence, maintenance and \ndissolution of terrorist networks will also provide insights into less destructive and more \nconstructive types of organizing.",

Dynamical processes, such\nas flow and electrical transport in heterogeneous networks,\nwere shown to be significantly more efficient when compared\nwith Erd\u00c6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi networks64,65.

The analytical\nframeworkisbasedonagenerating-functionformalismwidelyused\nforstudiesofpercolationandstructurewithinasinglenetwork73\u201375.\nThe framework for interdependent networks enables us to follow\nthe dynamics of the cascading failures as well as to derive the\nanalytic solutions for the final steady state. It was found73that\ncertain types of interdependent network were significantly more\nvulnerable than their non-interacting counterparts. The failure of\neven a small number of elements within a single network may\ntrigger a catastrophic cascade of events that destroys the global\nconnectivity. For a fully interdependent case in which each node\nin one network depends on a functioning node in other networks\nand vice versa, a first-order discontinuous phase transition, which\nis dramatically different from the second-order continuous phase\ntransition found in isolated networks (Fig. 1), was found73. This\nphenomenon is caused by the presence of two types of link:\nconnectivity links within each network; and dependence links\nbetween networks. Connectivity links enable the network to carry\nout its function and dependence links represent the fact that the\nfunction of a given node in one network depends crucially on\nnodes in other networks. The case of connectivity links between\nthe different networks was studied in ref. 66. It was shown76\nthat, when the dependence coupling between the networks is\nreduced, at a critical coupling strength the percolation transition\nbecomessecondorder.\nMorerecently,twoimportantgeneralizationsofthebasicmodel\nofref.73havebeendeveloped:One generalization takes into account that in real-world\nscenarios the initial failure of important nodes (or hubs) may\nbe not random but targeted. A mathematical framework for\nunderstanding the robustness of interdependent networks under\nan initial targeted attack has been studied in ref. 77. The\nauthors of that work developed a general technique that uses the\nrandom-attack problem to map the targeted-attack problem in\ninterdependentnetworks.\nThe other generalization takes into account that, in real-world\nscenarios, the assumption that each node in network A depends\non one and only one node in network B and vice versa may not\nbe valid. To correct this shortcoming, a theoretical framework for\nunderstanding the robustness of interdependent networks with a\nrandomnumberofsupportanddependencerelationshipshasbeen\ndevelopedandstudied78.\nIn all of the above studies73,76\u201378, the dependent pairs of\nnodes in both networks were chosen randomly.

Introduction\nBiological networks are currently widely used to represent the mechanisms of reciprocal\ninteraction between different biological entities and at different scales [ 1\u20133]. For example, if the\nentities are molecular, the networks can concern the genes and the control of their expression, or the\nenzymes and the regulation of the metabolism in living systems that possess them. At the other end of\nthe life spectrum, at the population level, biological networks are used to model interactions between\nindividuals, for example during the spread of contagious diseases, whether social or infectious [ 4,5].\nBetween these two molecular and population levels, the cellular level is also concerned by biological\nnetworks: for example, in the same neural tissue, cells such as neurons work together to give\nrise to emergent properties, such as those of the central nervous system related to memory [ 6] or\nmotion control [ 7].\nEntropy 2018 ,20, 36; doi:10.3390/e20010036 www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy",
        "ffeafb2f-5481-400c-995e-ada6e39d1bab": "Entropy 2018 ,20, 36 2 of 21\nAmong the tools used for quantifying the complexity of a biological network, the network\nentropies are ones of the most easy to calculate. They can be related to the network dynamics,\ni.e., calculated from the Kolmogorov-Sina\u00ef formula when the dynamics is Markovian, or they can\nrepresent the richness of the network attractors or con\ufb01nors [ 8], based on the relative weight of their\nattraction or con\ufb01nement basins in the network state space. A \ufb01nal way to calculate the entropy of\na random network is to use the invariant measure of its dynamics, giving birth to probability measures\nrelated to the characteristics of its nodes like centrality, connectivity, strong connected components size,\netc. The literature on network entropies is abundant and from reference to recent papers it is possible\nto \ufb01nd de\ufb01nitions and calculation algorithms in [ 9\u201322].\nDynamical systems, discrete or continuous, share common mathematical notions like initial\nconditions and attraction basin, \ufb01nal conditions and attractor, Jacobian graph, stability and robustness.\nMoreover, in an energetic view, there are in both cases, two extreme systems, i.e., on one hand,\nconservative systems with an energy constant along trajectories (e.g., Hamiltonian systems) and, on the\nother hand, dissipative systems with an energy decreasing along trajectories (e.g., potential systems).\nFor both Hamiltonian and potential systems, it is possible to de\ufb01ne at each point x of their state space\nE, a Jacobian matrix J(x)made of the partial derivatives of the \ufb02ow of the network dynamics, whose\nassociated graph having J(x)as incidence matrix, is called the interaction graph G(x) . The description\nof the dynamics in terms of energy conservation or dissipation is identical whether the system is time\ndiscrete or continuous.\nCommon de\ufb01nitions of the concepts of attraction basin and attractor will be recalled in Section 2\nMaterial and Methods, in which we give also some examples of Hamiltonian and potential systems\nby making explicit the energy functions underlying their dynamics, allowing for interpreting these\nfunctions in the precise context of different applications. For example, the energy functions can be\nrelated to the notions of frustration in statistical mechanics [ 23] or of kinetic energy, which can be\ncalculated in discrete systems by using an analogue of the continuous velocity [ 24]. In Section 3,\nwe present the Results through applications in three domains, neural (memory evocation based\non the synchronization of neural networks), genetic (regulation of the iron metabolism) and social\n(dynamics of the obesity spread in a college environment). We de\ufb01ne the thermodynamical notions of\nattractor entropy, dynamic (or evolutionary) entropy and entropy centrality for interpreting the results,\nand we relate the dynamic entropy to the robustness (or structural stability) of the dynamical systems\npresented. After, in Section 4, the Discussion presents the interest of a thermodynamic approach in\nsocial networks in order to simulate and evaluate the ef\ufb01ciency of public health policies, and eventually,\nthe Section 5gives the Conclusion and Perspectives of the paper.\n2. Material and Methods\n2.1. The Dynamical Tools\nSeveral de\ufb01nitions of attractor and stability have been proposed since 50 years. Here we use that\nof Cosnard and Demongeot [ 25,26], which covers both continuous and discrete cases.

Examples of Dissipative Energy\nIn a gradient system, the potential energy is dissipative, because it decreases along the trajectories\nand, more, its gradient is exactly equal to the system velocity. The existence of a morphogenetic\ndissipative energy has been speculated by the Waddington\u2019s school of embryology [ 38] as an ontology\nrule governing the development of living systems and we give in Section 2.2.2 an example of such\na dissipative energy.\n2.2.1.

Interactions between these blocks can exist (i.e., there are wij\u0338=0,\nwith iand jbelonging to two different blocks), and because the block sizes are different, the time at\nwhich the stationary state is reached in a block is not necessarily synchronized with the corresponding\ntimes in other blocks: the synchronization depends on the intra-block as well as on the inter-block\ninteractions.

The \ufb01rst is the betweenness\ncentrality [ 63]. It is be de\ufb01ned for a node kin the interaction graph Gas follows:\nCB(k) = \u2211\ni\u0338=j\u0338=k\u2208G\u03b2ij(k)\n\u03b2ij, (11)\nwhere \u03b2ij(k)is the total number of shortest paths from node ito node jthat pass through node k,\nand \u03b2ij=\u2211i\u0338=j\u2208G\u03b2ij(k).\nLet consider now a social network with a threshold Boolean dynamics following the Equation ( 7),\ncontaining overweight or obese (state 1) and normal (state 0) individuals as nodes. By concentrating the\npedagogic efforts on the betweenness central nodes overweight or obese with tolerance 1, which are\n\u201chubs\u201d of the social network, it results a rapid decrease of the number of overweight or obese,\nmore important if the educative effort has been done on individuals with tolerance 1 than with\ntolerance 0 (Figure 6Bottom right), as well as a decrease of their mean weight (Figure 6Bottom left).\nThe second corresponds to the degree centrality, which can be de\ufb01ned from the notions of out-, in- or\ntotal degree of a node i, corresponding to the number of arrows of the interaction graph, respectively\nouting, entering, or both, connected to i. For example, the in-degree centrality is de\ufb01ned by:\nCindeg\ni=\u2211\nj=1,...,n;j\u0338=Iaij/(n\u22121), (12)\nwhere the general coef\ufb01cient of the adjacency matrix Aof the graph, denoted aij, equals one if there is\na link between jand i, and else zero.\nThe third type of centrality is the closeness centrality. The closeness is the reciprocal of the average\nfairness, which is de\ufb01ned by averaging over all nodes jof the network else than ia distance between i\nand j, equal to \u2211j=1,...,n;j\u0338=id(i,j)/(n\u22121), then:\nCclo\ni= (n\u22121)/[\u2211\nj=1,...,n;j\u0338=id(i,j)] (13)\nwhere the chosen distance is the length of the closest path between iand j. The last type of classical\ncentrality is the spectral centrality or eigen-centrality, which takes into account that the neighbors of\na node ican be also highly connected to the rest of the graph (connections to highly connected nodes\ncontribute more than those of the weakly connected nodes). Hence, the eigen-centrality measures\nmore the global in\ufb02uence of ion the network and veri\ufb01es:\nCeigen\ni=\u2211\nj=1,...,n;j\u0338=iCeigen\nj/\u03bb (14)\nwhere \u03bbis the greatest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix Aof the graph.\nThe four centralities above have each their intrinsic interest: (i) the betweenness centrality of\na node is related to its global connectivity with all the nodes of the network, (ii) the degree centralities\nindicate the level of local connectivity (in-, out- or total) of a node with only its nearest nodes,\n(iii) the closeness centrality measures the relative proximity a node has with the other nodes of the\nnetwork for a given distance on the interaction graph of the network, and (iv) the eigen-centrality\ncorresponds to the ability for a node to be connected to possibly a few number of nodes, but having\nsecondarily a high connectivity, which indicates for example an important relay for the dissemination\nof news in social networks, the social networks being also used to model the spread of rumors, political\nopinions and social diseases, such as obesity and its most important consequence, type II diabetes.\nFor example, for curing a social disease, an Hospitaller Order of Saint Anthony has been founded\nin 1095 at La Motte (presently Saint Antoine near Grenoble in France) by Gaston du Dauphin\u00e9,",

Both nutrition\nmimicking and social stigmatization explain the dissemination of obesity into a social network [ 64,65].\nObesity consists in an excessive accumulation of fat in adipose tissue favoring chronic diabetic and\ncardiovascular diseases. In UK for example, 36% of men and 33% of women are predicted to be\nobese in 2030 for only 26% of both sexes in 2010 [ 66\u201369] showing the critical character of the present\nexplosion of obesity, especially in young people. For assessing the prevalence of the disease in young\npopulation, we have observed social graphs based on the existence or not of friendship between pupils\nin the 5th and 4h classes of two high schools (corresponding to ages from 11 to 13 years), one in\nFrance at J\u0153uf already published in [ 5], and a new one in Tunisia at Tunis. The corresponding graphs\n(Figure 6Top) and the histograms of the number F of friends of the pupils, show in both cases that the\ndistribution of F is uni-modal for normal weight pupils and bimodal for overweight or obese ones\n(Figure 6Middle), because of a double phenomenon in obese pupils: a part of them attracts with\na friendship link due to their open personality, and another part repulses. Then, we have done the\nsimulation of a preventive education of central obese nodes following WHO recommendations [ 70]\nduring the dynamics of obesity spread following the Equation ( 7), in which we give the tolerance h = 0\n(resp. h = 1) to the obese of the \ufb01rst (resp. second) mode.

The result is the best between the\nfour centralities de\ufb01ned above, but it remains an irreducible percentage of obese in the population of\ntolerance zero (Figure 6Bottom right). For that reason, we need to introduce a new notion of centrality\nbased on the notion of entropy.\n4. Discussion\n4.1. The Notion of Entropy Centrality\nIndeed, despite the interesting properties of the various classical centralities (Figures 6\u20138),\nthe therapeutic education targeting the most central nodes leaves in general a not-neglectible\npercentage of obese after education, then we will discuss now the introduction of a new notion\nof centrality, called the entropy centrality, taking into account the heterogeneity of the vector having as\ncomponents the state and the tolerance, into the neighbor set of the node i, and not only the connectivity\nof the graph:\nCentropy\ni=\u2212\u2211\nk=1,. . . , s\u03bdkLog\u03bdk, (15)\nwhere \u03bdkdenotes the kth frequency among sof the histogram of the values of the vector (state, tolerance)\nobserved in the neighborhood Vi, set of the nodes linked to the node i.\nThis new notion of centrality is more useful than the others to detect the good candidates to\nbe educated in order to transform their state to the normal state 0, because they can in\ufb02uence more\nef\ufb01ciently a heterogeneous environment to recover the normality. An illustration of this fact is done in\nthe example of the Section 3.3.\nBy comparing the results obtained thanks to a preventive and therapeutic education leading the\noverweight or obese nodes to the normal weight, we observe that with only the 21 individuals the\nmost entropic central educated (Figure 8Bottom right), all the population of pupils is going to the\nnormal weight state, but we need 68 individuals with the total degree, and 85 individuals with the\nin-degree and eigenvector centralities (Figure 8Top and Bottom left). Then, the best public health\npolicy against the obesity pandemics consists in using the notion of entropy centrality to select the\ntargets of the therapeutic education [ 5].",

For the con\ufb01guration xof the genetic network controlling\nthe \ufb02owering of Arabidopsis thaliana [ 77], there is only two frustrated pairs, hence F(x) =2 (Figure 10).\nMore generally, all the energy functions introduced in the examples are theoretically calculable\nand could serve as in physics for quantifying the structural stability. When the number of states in\na discrete state space E is too large, or when the integrals on a continuous state space E are dif\ufb01cult to\nevaluate, then Monte Carlo procedures can provide a good estimation of functions like the dynamic\nentropy or the variance of the global frustration.\nFigure 10. Frustrated pairs of nodes belonging to positive circuits of length 2 in the genetic network\ncontrolling the \ufb02owering of Arabidopsis thaliana. The network evolves by diminishing the global\nfrustration until the attractor (here a \ufb01xed con\ufb01guration, whose last changes are indicated in red) on\nwhich the frustration remains constant.\n5. Conclusions and Perspectives\nWe have de\ufb01ned some new tools based on the notion of entropy common to both continuous and\ndiscrete dynamical systems, based on thermodynamic concepts. These notions are useful in biological\nmodeling to express in which way precise energy functions related to the various concentrations\nor population sizes involved in the transition equation of a biological dynamical system can be\nconserved or dissipated along the trajectories until their ultimate asymptotic behavior, the attractors.\nFuture works could be done in the framework of more general random systems [ 78,79] in which\nthe notions of entropy, invariant measure and stochastic attractors (called also con\ufb01ners in [ 54]) are\nclassical to interpret the data observed in all the \ufb01elds (neural, genetic and social) considered in the\npresent study and use the interpretations they allow in practical applications (see for example [ 19,80]\nfor some biomedical applications).",

The term is used in a many ways and in many \ncontexts today within marketing science not to mention other social sciences. This \nholds when we look at different approaches where network terms are used as core \nconcepts in trying to highlight how networks affect business encounters. Technological \nnetworks (Hakansson 1987, 1989), infrastuctural networks (Hallen 1992), regional \nnetworks (Christensen et.al. 1990, Dicken 1992), industrial networks (e.g. Hagg & \nJohanson 1982, Ford 1990, Forsgren & Johanson 1992) and strategic networks (Jarillo \n1993) are examples of diverse streams of research all closely related to studies about \nbusiness networks from specific angles and perspectives. In a sense I think one sees at \ndifferent sides of a dice when using these various concepts about networks. On the other \nhand one is probably missing the point about understanding the whole and its parts in a \ncoherent manner when specifying a certain perspective in this way. I try to look at these \ndifferent approaches to networks and at the end to build a tentative model about how \nresearch could (or if it could) be affected by such a total view. The paper starts by \nlooking breifly at these above mentioned approaches concerning business (or industrial) \nnetworks and their core constituents. Thereafter an examination and analysis is made \ndealing with different network types used in the literature concerning business networks \nin business-to-business settings. A model dealing with the embedded nature of networks \nis thereafter presented and finally comments about research methods is made based on \nthe foregoing discussion. The paper is heavily based on a conceptual discussion and \nempirical examples are given briefly as illustrations. I use mainly the European and \nespecially Nordic research in this paper as a base.\n2. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES ON BUSINESS NETWORKS\nTheory about marketing in the form of relationships and networks is forming the core \nparadigm in the field of today. However networks are not easily grasped entities or \nrealities surrounding the business community.\nJohanson and Forsgren (1992) are inclined to view business networks as their own entity \nnot connected to other forms of networks:\n\"Business networks differ from social networks and from networks in general - by \nbeing coupled to business activities\" (Forsgren & Johanson 1992, 5.)\nIn being symphatetic in general to the authors' writing about networks I am still strongly \ninclined to believe that business networks are in fact very closely also a part of social\n616",
        "78f2337d-5b31-449f-9b73-9a590c9132d4": "networks. This concerns also relations to other kinds of networks. When focusing on \none type of networks these are here seen as a special kind of socially embedded networks \nformed by key actor relationships. These key actors are forming the hub and the \nrelationships to other actors and network members form the spokes in a network.(see fig. \n1.)\nSocial networks\nEmbedded Business\nNETWORKS\nFig. 1. - Different Types of Networks Coupled to Business Activities \nSource: Based on Tornroos 1995\nIn order to understand how business networks work one has to gain insights about the \nsocial setting - for example cultural and social processes - that guide and explain e.g. how \ntrust and commitment among business actors has been materialised. Therefore we cannot \navoid e.g. social networks in business network research. In fact social networks are \nalways embedded into business networks. Business networks are interconnected activities \nperformed by business actors in order to reach business objectives (Hagg & Johanson \n[eds]. (1982). Performing activities forming activity links and chains which tie the actors \ntogether form the basic principle explaining the core role of actors, activities and \nresources (Hakansson & Johanson 1985). Business networks are here the main type of \nnetworks we are interested in, that is the \"hub\" referred to above. This main focal \nbusiness net is, however, also embedded into other structures and networks in society \n(and often also vice versa). Institutional actors i.e. political or related actors at the local, \nregional and national levels are important. This is also the case, for example in Europe \ntoday, when the actors at the Union level have important functions. Connecting resources\n617",

In this way these different types of networks \nbecome - directly or indirectly - a part of the business network (cp. Hallen 1992 and the \ndimension below concerning infrastructural networks).\nThe model presented above is based on those networks which are coupled mainly to \nbusiness activities and have close connections to these. In telling this one has still to \nremeber that also business networks vary and change over time, space and in different \ncontexts (e.g. industry, competitive situations and so forth). The different network types \nare hereafter evaluated in how they can exert an influence on busienss networks and how \nthey can be seen as embedded into these. The presentation related to the model starts \nfrom the 'smallest' but in many ways from the most important 'network type', that is the \nsocial relationships.\n2.1. Social Networks\nSocial interaction and communication is of paramount importance when dealing with \ndifferent network types and actors connected to business. This is, almost without \nexception, the case when dealing with socially constructed phenomena in society. New \ntypes of actors emerge (in a faster pace than before, it seems, in many cases) having an \nimportant role to play in todays' business nets. Environmental groups, new consumer \ngroups, deviating social groups, private enterpreneurs and relationships between large and \nsmall firms in the production network are some examples of social (or closely social- \nbound) networks affecting a business. Also complex relationships between different types \nof networks exist (see section 3 below). Social networks are always present when \ntransferring value in the form of knowledge, technology and other skills within the \nbusiness network. This is esepcially important when dealing with critical incidents and \nchange processes in networks) decision makers are always human. The social \norganisation and social processes together with communication forms the social setting \nand influences strongly the development of the network, (cp. Granovetter 1973, Scott \n1990). Social networks are dealing with the interconnected exchange relationships which \nexist between the socially embedded actors in business networks. In this sense the \nconcepts of culture (in international encounters especially) as well as how to create trust, \ncommitment and a favourable atmosphere are basically social constructs concerning \nbusiness networks. Trust is the combined sum of socially developed ties between \nindividuals through experience and business histories. It is enhanced and created by social \ninteraction. Managers doing business are transferring trust into the organisation and \nbetween organisations. Commitment can be said to be a result of trust as well. Another \nperspective is that commitment is seen as a internal promise to \"go for\" certain actions in \nconnection with one (or more) business counterparts for joint action (or\n618",
        "9ca32f42-5158-4735-9fed-2e6baea4d3c3": "enhancing/delivering goods, services, technology, management know-how and the like). \nCommitment also means to tie oneself up with specific business counterparts and \nexclude, in many cases, others. Atmosphere is seen as the social \"feeling\" which is \ncreated by business interaction between the dyadic counterparts in industrial business \nmarkets - at a certain point in time (Hakansson 1982). This can be understood as the joint \nterm denoting the \"state of trust and commitment\" and social understanding or social \ncohesion between the actors in a business network at one point in time. In this sense the \nsocial networks lie in the heart of business networks. Understanding the social behaviour \nof business actors is a core perspective in business networks. The role of representation \nmight be added as well (Halinen & Tornroos [forthcoming].) This concept relates to the \nrole played by certain persons/actors in a business setting, e.g. within a specific type of \nindustry. Certain key persons are representing a specific firm and in some cases also are \ntop mangers within a certain industry and \"represent\" strongly the know-how, image and \nskills acquired through earlier bonding and commitment.\n2.2. Networks and Technology\nThe role of technological aspects in business marketing is seen as crucial in many studies. \nIn the business networks stream of research the two books written and edited by \nHakansson are well known (Hakansson (ed.) 1987, Hakansson 1989). Technology forms \none basic competitive edge in many industries and can be materialised through intensive \nco-operation between firms possessing various heterogeneous skills and competencies \nwhich are interconnected through technological interaction. In certain fields technological \nco-operation is especially important (high-tech, computing, electronics, and so on). \nConnecting heterogeneous skills and competencies can be self-enforced or enhanced by \nvarious means by institutional actors. Creation of industrial estates and technopoles as \nwell as forming entities between universities and business firms exemplify this. \nTechnological value creation and the use of new and \"edge technologies\" both in process, \nproduct and marketing) terms is a strong force in networking. It creates also strong \nbonding and mutual dependence in some cases. Technology seems also the be strongly \ninterlinked to specific areas/regions where the innovations emanate from (see section \nbelow).\n2.3. Geographical and Infrastructural Networks\nGeographical (or regional, spatial) networks looks at how business networks are located \nin different places and in relation to each other and how this location affects business \ninteraction and its international and regional setting. Araujo and Easton use the notion of\n619",
        "9eb6b7b9-c7bd-4f1f-9f6f-b39bc9553a07": "\"networks in economic geography\" (Araujo and Easton 1996). To my mind the notion \n\"Corporate geography\" is in tthis specific contyextr a more appropriate term to study this \nspecific phenomenon concerning business network location of corporations. Networks \ndo not exist without their spatial context and it can be argued that space and location \nmeans a great deal for business success in contemporary marketing and \ninternationalisation of the firm (Conti 1993, Maskell 1990). Recent developments in \nEastern Europe and in Pacific Asia clearly demonstrates the need to be located actively in \ngrowing markets in order to tap diverse forms of resources and new and emerging and in \nmany cases expanding markets. Contacts through networks of interpersonal relationships \nboth at the political as well as the individual firm level is crucial in order to survive both in \ne.g. Eastern and Central Europe as well as in China and the Pacific of today. In the \nliterature in economic and corporate geography the regional networks have been dealt \nwith in a manysided way. One aspect has been the succes of regional business networks \nin certain specific areas (The so called Third Italy', the Rhone-Alps region, Baden- \nWiirttemberg, Route 128 and Silicon Valley in the USA and e.g. the Johore Triangle \naround Singapore and the Special Economic Zones in the coastal China). Ann Markusen \n(1997) name these as being \"Sticky Places in Slippery Space\".\nThe success in many cases can be explained by regionally specific cultural ways of \ncreating successful networks of relationships between companies in business. Producer- \nsubcontractor relationships, the use of new technology and using the cultural base in the \nregion in accomplishing successful business systems (cp. Whitley 1989, Whitley 1992) \nAnother perspective put forth by the regional network research has been the use of \nflexible modes of production. In doing this the change from economies of scale has been \nreplaced by focusing on the use of economies of scope. This mode of production which \nhas made it possible to flexibly and quickly respond and tailor-make the specific tastes \nand changes in consumers and buyers specific needs. (Christensen et.al. 1990, Dicken \n1992, Piore & Sabel 1984).\nThird, the role of new technology is seen in this research to be of critical importance in \nbeing able to; (i) transmit and transform the needs and desires into the production plants \nand vice-versa, and (ii) to be able to process the production and logistics to the market \nefficiently. This has been named the \"flexibility debate\" or the \"new industrial districts\" \ndiscussion within corporate geography.\nA fourth perspective is the global-local interface which has been explained as a reason for \nbeing able to efficiently combine the interdependence between the global and the local. \nThe (national level seems in many ways to be of minor importance today in many parts of \nthe world). The rise of regional economic couplings and regional markets on the \nsupranational level form one aspect of the \"regionalisation\" of the business environment. \nThe other consequence of the \"borderlessness\" within the borders of the EU, for \nexample, has been the rise of local economics and networks between business partners in \nthe value chain (Ohmae 1995).\n620",
        "e85cea27-3b38-4012-8729-2b20753f6cfd": "An additional aspect has been the vertical disintegration of MNCs which has created more \nlocally and regionally based business networks between large and smaller corporations \n(cp. Castells, 1996, Harvey 1996 in order to look more in detail into these developments \nwithin the field of geography). The line of inquiry into business networks within \ncorporate geography is taking mostly their studies to understand production over space \nand how production is organised in the regime called \"flexible accumulation\". Many \ntheoretical constructs and aspects are in many writings taken from a structuralist \nframework and vocabulary.\nInfrastructural networks is a more tricky issue and the concept clearly relates to the \naforementioned regional networks. Hallen (1992, p. 77-79) postulates that infrastructural \nnetworks are contact networks formed mainly through personal access which can be \nused for diverse business uses. He does not discuss the regional or spatial networks \nwhich also can in one sense be defined as infrastructural networks and forming a web of \nactors and institutions and built environments for business purposes. We can therefore \nsay that there exist personal infrastructural networks as well as physico-geographical \ninfrastructural networks which both are used as integral parts of business in a \n\"networking\" sense.\n2.4. Institutional and Political Networks\nInstitutional networks are embedded into business networks as well. Social-institutional \nactors form the web of relationships to handle in order to do business. In some points in \ntime (e.g. in doing major investments) these actors are forming core players coupled with \nbusiness interests. In dealing with these social assets as well as communicative and \neconomic skills are needed in order to reach common objectives. Institutional networks \nare closely related to social networks, because they form an social network of their own. \n\"Social networks are interpersonal communication structures that lies in the heart of all \nkinds of human-made networks\" (Scott 1991, Ch. 1). Networks in business do not \ndiverge from this fact, that they are social and \"Man made\" to their nature, to a great \nextent. In this specific case the connected institutional actors have specific \nconfigurations. Political actors (locally, regionally, nationally and supra-nationally [e.g. the \nEU]), environmental groups, communication and media as well as core business actors in \nthe web are interconnected and play - in specific cases different roles, directly or \nindirectly, within a specific business context at a specific time. This is just to name a few \nsocially functioning players in a hypothetical sense. The Greenpeace' campaign agains't \nthe Finnish forest industry in the 1990s form a good example. Lobbying in Brussels is \nanother and having close links to political groups on the local level is well known.\n621",
        "f4362a6e-a802-4b14-8769-3eed206bd81f": "2.5. Networks, NeTwOrKs, NETworks....\nAraujo and Easton (1996) are also taking the discussion about research approaches into \nnetworks to the fore. Their aim is to try to make an overview of different research \napproaches to networks in the economic and social sciences. They are dealing with the \napproaches into networks in trying to build an taxonomy by looking at how networks \nhave been usen in the different approaches presented.\nTheir approach is more an overview not looking specifically at business networks and \nhow they are related to the other networks existing simultaneously in conjunction with \nbusiness networks. The nested and embedded relationships which exist as a reality and \ninterdependently with each other is the focus of this paper. This is the reason why the \nheadline is created here the way it is. Business networks are not solely \"business\" but \ncoupled to social, technological, geographical, infrastructural and institutional networks in \ninternational marketing networks, for example, in a specific way. In another temporal \n(and spatial) sense one can add that the composition of the embedded nature of a \nbusiness network varies - at seemingly faster rate than before dua to techological change \nand intertnationalization and new forms of competition.\nOne is inclined in this context to strongly support the powerful but complex concept of \nembeddedness in trying to come to terms with business networks and other forms of \nnetworks directly or indirectly being a part of the business net (Granovetter 1973, 1985). \nHow embeddedness works in a specific business context in time and space and related to \nthe existing networks should highlight the diverse role and interconnectedness of \nnetworks for business success. Indirect and direct network links to the different kinds of \nexisting networks could be one key to grasp embeddedness.\nNetworks can be seen to have structural as well as social (and/or cultural) aspects \nexisting as important parts of networks. Temporality should be one key issue in being \nable to trace the processual nature of business networks and change (as well as stability). \nHistorical, present and future temporal modes should be taken into account when doing \nresearch and in order to understand the evolution of networks and e.g. how trust and \ncommitment has been manifested in business networks.\nThe structural aspects are easily traceable and more straightforwardly understood aspects \nof business networks. The social aspects are to a larger extent invisible and traceable \nthrough qualitative understanding by the researcher in specific network settings. \nTrustbuilding, atmosphere, relation-bound investments, personal bonds etc. are important \nparts explaining the existence of networks but still needs elaborate measures and \nunderstanding in order to be researcheable.\n622",
        "3123e714-d57e-49ea-b2c6-0d9aaf82ea3e": "Different kinds of relationships in business networks exist often simultaneously. The \nrelationship concept has a crucial role to play, and is in turn multifunctional. The \nrelationship concept is an important issue of its own (see e.g. Holmlund & Tornroos \n1996).\n3. A MODEL OF EMBEDDED NETWORK RELATIONSHIPS\nTaking the embedded nature of relationships as a starting point when studying networks \none could discuss the existence of social relationships within a business network as one \nimportant part of a business network. Institutional and political relations, regional and \nlocational aspects and infrastructural contacts as well as technologically based actors \nforming a web of relationships in a business setting all play their role in a business \nnetwork. Using the perspective as indicated by Forsgren and Johanson would still mean \nthat the interconnectedness between different types of networks within the business \nsetting prevail and is, directly or sometimes indirectly, a part of the business network (see \nfig 2.)\nThis model puts forth the networks within and between different kind of actors \nembedded into business networks in various ways. In this conceptual paper the empirical \ncontent is not yet put forth. It surely is also a complex task to perform.\nExamples can be given where these modelled network structures come into play more or \nless overlapping in real-life business contexts. The following example comes from a \nNordic business entry and development in Estonia recently.\nWhen Western business took off in Eastern Europe after 1989, the largest Finnish \nbrewery Hartwall together with the Swedish Brewery Pripps (Procordia) took over Saku \nbreweries in Estonia. In this specific case one could see clearly the interdependence and \nthe existence of different kinds of networks in relation to the core business network. \nInstitutional and political actors in Estonia were decisive at the startup-phase. Technology \nand core competence as well as managerial skills were also present when the old \ntechnology from the Helsinki brewery was set up at the plant in Tallinn. Regional and \nlocational networks were established as the new brewery was set up and new markets \nwere found. (Transports, marketing nets, logistical issues were part of this establishing \nphase of different networks). This short story tells about the existence of different kinds \nof networks in the entry process. In fact it also tells a lot more. It tells about the temporal \nperspective and change in networks. At some points in time certain actors are more \nimportant than others in a network (e.g. political actors in the EU or Eastern Europe or\n623",
        "b42fd079-d5c1-4e73-bc8d-914dc0dfb0ec": "other \"institutional actors\" in the Pacific who act as gatekeepers for business at the first \nentry phase). In another situation the technological actors might be in the fore, e.g. within \nthe case of building a new market for mobile phones in China, for example. In some \ncases the institutional and political nets lose their importance and other more business- \nrelated networks come into playing the major role in networks. Due to changes in the \nmacro-environment and through new legislation etc. these actors can again get a core \nposition directly or indirectly for the business.\nTo sum up. Business networks are embedded into political networks, social networks and \nto infrastrucrural nets. Depending on the situation social networks representing one or a \nfew or all these network actors are a part of business networks and influence directly or \nindirectly their power through strong or weak ties, depending on the situation.\nACTIVX\nIT1ES\nL/R\ns\nSocial\nBusiness\\\nMarketRE\n\\\nIndustrySOIRl\nSociety:ES\nExternal markets/environments\nFig. 2.

        "88e37cf1-ca68-44cb-9d4e-f9898712300a": "'possibility structure' for the actor firms (Strandvik & Tomroos [forthcoming]). \nPossibility structures are seen as those possibilities a firm is perceiving as possible \ncontacts in relation to their business at a certain moment. One could say it is their 'mental \nmap' concerning in seeing the landscape of potential business partners. This pyramid \nextends the notion of networks as an \"opportunity space\" where actors, activities and \nresources are said to exist in a multi-layered existence.\n4. SOME METHODOLOGICAL QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS\nMethods in dealing with both embeddedness and change as well as delimiting a study \nconcerning industrial or business networks is a tricky issue. Some main points derived \nfrom the previous discussion is commented here.\nThe first problem concens stability and change aspects in business networks. In order to \ncome to terms with change and processes - that is how networks change over time has \nto take into consideration longitudinal methods and methods that can cope with change \nand evolution (processual analysis). This means that the research also takes a long time \nand accordingly needs a lot of investments from the researchers.\nSecond. The role of temporality is further complex, because both historical and situational \nfactors as well as future expectations often affect relationships in business networks. \nThis means consequently that the research should be made taking different temporalities \ninto consideration when doing research and gathering, and analysing data (Halinen & \nTornroos 1995).\nThe role of embeddedness is a problem as well. In a research setting dealing with core \nactors in a business network many actors can be seen to be embedded and affecting a \nbusiness network at different times and in different ways. These interconnections and \nchanges and influential persons and/or groups can in some cases be a problematic issue \nto tackle and delimit however carefully you try to delimit your study. Delimitation is \nimportant but difficult in networks research because everything is so much \ninterconnected, and it can sometimes be difficult to separate effects by just not noting \nthem!\nTrying to give a holistic view of how the embedded nature of different actors is affecting \nthe development of a business network is problematic as indicated above. This forms one \nmethodological obstacle as well. This is the case especially in extensive studies among \nmany business enterprises and actors. This kind of a holistic study could be made only \nwithin a limited number of cases.\n625",
        "fc7d5b3b-0a73-40f5-9242-6c45c85488f8": "These form some very crude problem-areas in a methodological sense. There are many \nmore, which deserve a more thorough analysis separately.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\nForsgren & Johanson distinguish business networks from social nets (Forsgren & \nJohanson p. 5) and from strategic networks (op. cit. p. 7.) In this paper this is disputed \non the grounds of the existence of embeddedness and connections between these \ndifferent network structures as indicated in fig. 1. Also in reality one can find good \nexamples of how these networks are seen as a part of business networks directly or \nindirectly.\nTheoretically we might need a more solid conceptual ground and holistic models to deal \nwith the embedded nature of business relationships and networks (Halinen & Tornroos \n[forthcoming]). Methodologically the change and development phases should be \nhighlighet in order to get a clear picture of existing different networks and actors having \nan indirect and direct impact on the business network. This means having a close access \nto the companies studied and their range of relationships to the different actors. \nIt has been said that the borders between regions, nation-states and between organisations \nare more elusive today than during the sixteies and seventies (Ohmae 1995). This has \nmany reasons. One being the end of the cold war. Other is the new regionalisation of the \nworld economy to the Triad. Another feature is the new international interdependence. \nThe role of the new information technology and the formation of \"global villages\" is \nanother dimension. The rise of regional economies an couplings is an additional outcome \nof recent business and structuring of business in certain \"sticky\" places especially. The \nrole of the environmental perspectives should either be forgotten. This relates to the \n\"environment\" in the pyramid model above. Environamnt can be seen as being located in \nmany parts of the pyramid creating an \"opportunity structure\" to be seen and handled in \nits own right.\nBusiness is ultimately embedded in the constitutions of societies where the firm operates - \nan into larger entities like the EU, for example. In the second perspective firms are \nembedded into their business, markets, industry and competiton. The opportunities are \nmainly located in the region(s) where the networks operate and function. Additionally \nnetwoirks are embedded in the social geography of the core business actors within the \ncontext where a firm is operating. This forms the intra-micro perspective where trust, \ncommitment and atmosphere and the final decisions are made within business and other \nforms of networks.

How does the human brain work? How can we make sentences and m ake sentences? These are the questions \ndealt with already many scientists and several companies develo ping artificial intelligence. This article presents a study \non language networks. At the beginning is the research of the w orks that have already dealt with this issue. In the next \npart, the author deals with the application of language network s and semantic networks. \nINTRODUCTION \nArtificial intelligence modeling is already standard on at leas t two levels of abstraction, at conceptualization and \nimplementation level. On the first one, i.e. at a higher level of abstraction, conceptualization takes place, the output \nof which is a conceptual model in language. Although this langu age has already strict formal rules, it also has \nlanguage resources that can be understood by the layman as well, thus contributing to the creation o f a conceptual \nmodel of the defined reference system. The second level uses  the language as a rule to implement the model, which \nis a modification of the first-o rder logic language and require s deeper mastering of language resources. [1] \nIn linguistics, the so-called Ullmann's triangle, which illustr ates the relationships between reality, abstract \nconcepts and their linguistic rep resentation, is well known (Fi gure 1).

The language expression of the \"college\" in the \nCzech language (in Czech \u201ckoleje \u201d) may respond by a conceptuali zation of reality \"railway,\" in another \nconceptualization \"accommodation buildings for students.\" [1] \nLANGUAGE NETWORKS \nIf network structure is a  potential key for understanding univ ersal statistical trends, then the first step is clearly \nto define more precisely what ki nds of networks are involved. I t turns out that there are several possibilities (Fig. 1). \n[2] First of all, we can look at t he network structure of the language elements themselves, a nd this at different levels: \nsemantics and pragmatics, syntax, morphology, phonetics and pho nology. Second, we can look at the language \ncommunity and the social structures defined by their member s. Social networks can help in understanding how fast \nnew conventions propagate or what  language variation will be su stained [2, 3]. \nMoreover, the network organization of individual interactions h as been shown to influence the emergence of a \nself-consistent language [2, 4] \nHow to build language networks.  \nStarting from a given text (a) we  can define different types of  relationships between words, including precedence \nrelations and syntactic relations. In (b) we show them using blue and black arrows, respectively. In figures (c) and \n(d) the corresponding co-occurr ence and syntactic networks are shown. Paths on the network (c) can be understood \nas the potential universe of sentences that can be constructed with the given lexicon. An example of such a path is \nthe sentence indicated in red. [2] \nNodes have been colored according to the total (in- and out-) w ord degree, highlighting key nodes during \nnavigation (The higher the degree the lighter its color). In (d ) we build the corresponding syntactic network, taking \nas a descriptive Framework depend ency syntax (50), assuming as a criterion that arcs begin in complements and end \nin the nucleus of the phrase; taking the verb as the nucleus of  well-formed sentences. The previous sentence appears \nnow dissected into two different paths converging towards \u201etry. \u201c An example of the global pattern found in a larger \nnetwork is shown in (e) which is the occurrence network of a fr agment of Moby Dick. In this graph hubs, we have \nthe, a, of, to. [2] \n \nSEMANTIC NETWORKS \nSemantic networks (Figure 3) [5, 6, 7] consist of individual wo rds that lexicalize concepts and then map basic \nsemantic relationships (for example such as is special types of  isa-relationships) that must be a binary relation (this \nis the main condition semantic networks). They can be potential ly built automatically from corpus data [8, 9, 10, \n11]. The topology of these networks reveals highly efficient or ganizations, where mushrooms are polysemantic \nwords that have a great effect on the overall structure. It has  been suggested that hubs organize a semantic web in a \ncategorical representation and explain the ubiquity of polysemy in different languages [8]. In this context, w hile \nclaiming that polysemy may be som e type of historical accident (which should be avoided), the analysis of these \nsites instead suggests that they are a necessary component of a ll languages. Additionally, as discussed in [9], the \ntopology without semantic network  radiation creates some limita tions on how these websites (and the ones \npreviously) can be implemented into neural hardware. The high c lustering found in these sites favors search by \nassociation, whereas short paths  separating two arbitrary items  glance [2, 10] \nSemantic networks can define different ways. Figure 2 shows a s imple network of semantic relationships \nbetween lexicalized concepts. Nodes are the terms and links of semantic relations are between concepts. Links are \ncolored to highlight the different nature of relationships. Yel low arcs define isa-relationships (Flower \u2192 Rose \nindicates that Flower is hypernym Rose). Two concepts are linke d by a blue arc when there is a partial relationship \nbetween them. Binary opposition relations are bi-directional and violet-colored. Isa- relationship defines a tree-\nstructured network, and other relationships create shortcuts th at lead the network to disp lay a small world pattern, \nmaking it easier and easier to nav igate the network.

How to jointly represent the two types of\nnetworks is not trivial as the layers and not the nodes of the layers of the re-\nported networks are coupled through a network on the reports. We propose\nto transform the different multiple networks using line graphs, where actors\nare af\ufb01liated with ties represented as nodes, and represent the totality of the\ndifferent types of ties as a multilevel network. This affords studying the\nassociations between the social network and the reports as well as the align-\nment of the reports to a criterion graph. We illustrate how the procedure can\nbe applied to studying the social construction of knowledge in local \ufb02ood\nmanagement groups.

For a realisation E\u2282 E of ties, we let X= (Xij)be the standard\nadjacency matrix. Here we assume that for index set V={1,...,n}, we have\nadjacency matrices X1,...,Xn, representing the networks H={H1,...,Hn},\non the same node set Nand set of pairs E. In addition, we assume that the nodes\nofVare connected through a network M. We allow for the existence of a \ufb01xed\nand given criterion graph G(N,E). We propose to represent the totality of ties as\na multilevel network (Lazega et al., 2008) on two node sets, where one node set\nisVand the other is Etreated as a set of nodes. The latter is key to retaining all\ninformation, and by recognising that E, treated as a set of nodes, means that these\nnodes are not independently de\ufb01ned but connected through the shared, constituent\nnodes inN. These latter connections are represented through a network Qon the\nnode setE. The new multilevel network thus represents a networkM, ofnetworks\nH1,...,Hn.\nThere is a long tradition of analysing multiplex networks (Mitchell, 1974;\nDavis, 1968; Wasserman and Faust, 1994), with many of the classic network\ndatasets (Sampson, 1969; Kapferer, 1972; Padgett and Ansell, 1993) speci\ufb01cally\ndesigned to investigate the interrelation of different types of ties. For a multiplex\nnetwork, Hrepresents different relations on N. The networks Hmay also rep-\nresent repeated observations on the same type of tie through time or by different\nreporters. An example of the latter is when multiple raters report on the same\nrelation, such as the cognitive social structures (CSS) data collection paradigm\n(Moreno, 1934; Newcomb, 1961; Krackhardt, 1987). The challenges associated\nwith the joint analysis of multiplex networks are well documented (White 1963;\nWhite et al., 1976; Pattison 1993; Lazega and Pattison, 1999; Rivero Ostoic, 2020)\nas are the issues with analysing multiple raters without having a gold standard net-\nwork onNfor reference in CSS (see e.g., Butts, 2003). Nevertheless, a wealth\nof research has come out of the study of multiple networks in the form of H.\nFor multiplex analysis nis typically small, enabling the researcher to formulate\nspeci\ufb01c hypotheses about how the networks Hare related (Koehly and Pattison,\n2005). Large nleads to a combinatorial explosion that makes investigating the-\noretically informed multiplexities dif\ufb01cult but large nstill permits exploration of\ndimensions of relations (V\u00f6r\u00f6s and Snijders, 2017); relational algebras (Rivero\nOstoic, 2017, 2020) and testing of structure using a multigraph representation\n(Sha\ufb01e, 2015). For CSS n=Nand the main challenge is typically how to relate\nHto an unobserved consensus structure or criterion graph G(N,E).\nThere is a growing number of conceptual frameworks for joint analysis of\ndifferent types of ties over different types of nodes, such as multilevel networks\n(Lazega et al., 2008), multilayered networks (Kivel\u00e4 et al., 2014), sociosemantic\n2",
        "ef3d40f9-ac80-4d26-9d8a-e4d5560e8898": "networks (Basov, 2020), socioecological networks (Bodin et al., 2016), etc. Many\non them have in common that networks on different types of nodes are connected\nthrough two-mode af\ufb01liation ties. In particular, a network Gis connected to a\nnetworkM, through af\ufb01liations BlinkingVtoN. This af\ufb01liation network con-\nsequently connects a social network with another type of network, on a different\nnode setN. If we have multiple networks on N, and that it is these networks\nthat are connected through social ties, the multilevel one-mode by two-mode rep-\nresentation does not apply straightforwardly. For multilevel networks, there are\ninstances where multiple networks on Nmay add insight over and above the rep-\nresentation using af\ufb01liations of Vto nodes in N. For example, Wang et al. (2015),\nstudy consumer preferences among products in a product layer, network of sim-\nilarities among products, and a social network among consumers in a socioma-\nterial network (Contractor et al., 2011). In the canonical representation of clans,\nforestry, and ecology in the socioecological network of Bodin and Teng\u00f6 (2012),\nthe clans are assumed to act on a universally understood network Gof forests.\nThis ecological network Gof forest could be disaggregated and represented as\neach clan\u2019s perception or understanding H1,...,Hnof how forests are related.\nIn sociosemantic networks (Roth and Cointet, 2010; Hellsten and Leydesdorff,\n2017; Basov, Lee, and Antoniuk, 2016; Basov, 2020), the semantic network may\nbe taken as a normative, exogenously given network Gthat social actors relate to\nthrough af\ufb01liations Bwith concepts. If the semantic network is a local semantic\nnetwork, aggregated across individual meaning structures (the personal \u2018semantic\nnetworks\u2019) H1,...,Hn, the local semantic network may be disaggregated into n\nversions of how the concepts are related.\nMultiplex approaches can handle complex dependencies between and within\nHfor smalln. CSS may handle the comparison of Hand a criterion graph G\nfor largenassuming independence between and within reports V, conditional on\nG. Accounting for complex dependencies within and between Hcomparing to a\ncriterion graph Gis thus a considerable challenge. In particular, how do we ac-\ncount for dependence between report, conditionally on Gif these dependencies are\ninduced by a network MonV? Here we propose mapping {H,G,M} to a mul-\ntilevel network (Lazega et al., 2008) on VandEas nodes, with ties de\ufb01ned by M\nandH, andGrepresented by node-level covariates. We present how meaningful\nhypotheses for the original representation of data may be translated into hypothe-\nses expressed in terms of con\ufb01gurations (Moreno and Jennings, 1938) in the new,\nmultilevel form. The multilevel representation of the network of networks means\nthat a network of networks lends itself to estimation using any model or statisti-\ncal package that can model multilevel networks, such as stochastic actor-oriented\nmodels (Hollway et al., 2017), exponential random graph models (Wang et al.,\n2013), and blockmodels (\u017dibena and Lazega, 2016). We illustrate the application\nof the representation to test hypotheses about the local production of knowledge\n3",

We \ufb01nd dyadic social network effects on\nknowledge: People who are socially connected also tend to connect the same con-\ncepts via meaningful associations, i.e., to generate knowledge jointly. Moreover,\nthe multilevel representation of network of networks approach allows us to show\nthat alignment with a normative semantic network (here, of expert knowledge)\nmoderates local social production of knowledge. This opens new methodologi-\ncal prospects for studying the dispositional effects on local production of culture\n(Rawlings and Childress, 2019)\n2 Multilevel representation\nWhen having one-mode networks among a set of actors that are also af\ufb01liated\nwith organisations, that, in turn, are connected amongst themselves, Lazega et al.\n(2008) propose to represent the totality of ties in a multilevel network. A multi-\nlevel network thus has two types of nodes and three types of ties. While the multi-\nlevel network could be represented as one one-mode network, where the types of\nties were identi\ufb01ed by their constituent nodes, Lazega et al. (2008) demonstrate\nthe analytical advantages that can be had from retaining a strict distinction be-\ntween the networks. In particular, the multilevel representation affords specifying\ndifferent types of dependencies depending on the combination of the types of ties\nthat are used.\n2.1 Network of networks\nIn the original representation of data used here {H,G,M}, there is a clear dis-\ntinction between the nodes on Gand theHi\u2019s, on the one hand, and the nodes of\nMon the other. The nodes of Vhave ties amongst themselves but they do not\nhave ties to the nodes of G, something which makes the joint representation less\nthan trivial. To de\ufb01ne a joint representation, consider the representations of the\noriginal data HandGin Figure 1 and Min Figure 2.\nThe networks in Figure 1 could represent a multiplex network where i,j, and\nk, are different relations and Gan additional fourth relation. In the CSS framework\nthe nodeset Nwould be the same as V, andGwould represent some consensus\ngraph on the same node set. In the case of multiplex networks and nsmall, we\ncould formulate speci\ufb01c hypotheses for how the networks Hrelate pair-wise to\neach other. For example in the case of generalised exchange, we might ask if a\ntie{s,v}inHkcloses an open triad {{s,u},{u,v}}inHi. For CSS, we may\nintroduce dependencies on Vthrough, for example, asserting that respondents are\nmore accurate when reporting on their own ties (Krackhardt, 1987; Batchelder et\nal. 1997; Butts, 2003; Koskinen, 2004).

Symbolic interactionist concep-\ntion of social behaviour is based on the premise that people collectively construct\nknowledge about reality rather than passively reproduce images of the world im-\nposed on them: \u201c[h]uman group life on the level of symbolic interaction is a vast\nprocess in which people are forming, sustaining, and transforming the objects of\ntheir world as they come to give meaning to objects\u201d (Blumer, 1986: 12; Mead,\n1934). Interacting ( M), individuals use signs and associations of signs ( H) that\nrefer to a context where their interaction unfolds and constitute knowledge about\nreality (Mead, 1934). The interaction context here is \ufb02ood management in their\ncommunities. The act of knowledge creation can be thought of as three interre-\nlated processes that lead to multilevel, social entrainment as in Figure 9 (Trian-\ngleXAC). Firstly, to indicate the meaning of an object/action actor A would use\nsigns familiar to B and avoid using signs that are incomprehensible for the group\nthat both A and B belong to (e.g. technical jargon). This entails two levels of\nentrainment, one is the entrainment in Figure 7 (XASB) and the more structural\nentrainment in Figure 8 (XACA), neither of which involves de\ufb01ning the inter-\naction in terms of M, rather using membership in the group Vas the reference\npoint. Secondly, in interaction between A and B meanings indicated by A are\neither con\ufb01rmed or rejected by B. This constitutes the other level of entrainment\n18",
        "47b19005-6e83-4077-a68f-2ae3106444de": "presented in Figure 9. The shared signs and meaningful associations between\nthem constitute community knowledge. Thirdly, the con\ufb01rmation of the indicated\nmeanings by actor B becomes a stimulus for individual A to continue interac-\ntion. According to these three processes, actors can reproduce and transform local\nknowledge. Reproduction of knowledge involves actors restating already shared\nsigns and associations between signs . Transformation involves recon\ufb01guration\nof associations between signs as a result of interaction between actors. Knowl-\nedge reproduction and transformation are carried out through several mechanisms\nworking at dyadic and extra-dyadic levels and summarised by Antonyuk et al\n(2019). The cross-sectional data, however, do not allow distinguishing between\nknowledge reproduction and transformation. Similarly, for the social ties, they\nmay be created from various forms of social alignment or they may be recon\ufb01g-\nured to reduce breach of social alignment. In what follows we offer examples of\nsuch mechanisms and their statistical representations.\n3.2.1 Knowledge reproduction and transformation at dyadic level: Selec-\ntion and contagion\nKnowledge reproduction can take place through the mechanism of \u2018selection\u2019.\nThis mechanism can be observed in different contexts, for example, when people\nseek to establish reliable knowledge about an object or an event. In this situa-\ntion, the identical elements in different indicated meanings are considered reliable,\nwhile the divergent parts are dismissed as subjective or inaccurate.\nFor example, discussing \ufb02ood relief measures, A and B may disagree on what\nkind of help, e.g. money or material supplies, needs to be provided to the vic-\ntims of a recent \ufb02ood . At the same time, disagreeing on a particular type of\naid throughout interaction, they at least agree that some help has to be provided\nto the victims (both A and B retain links between signs \u2018provide\u2019 and \u2018victim\u2019).\nThus, by dismissing con\ufb02icting meanings (i.e. dismissing links \u2018victim\u2019 - \u2018money\u2019\nand \u2018victim\u2019 - \u2018material supplies\u2019 previously used by A and B, respectively), the\nmechanism of selection helps reproduce the common ground necessary for col-\nlaboration between the actors.\nKnowledge transformation can take place through the mechanism of \u2018con-\ntagion\u2019. Contagion occurs when one group member starts using an association\nbetween signs as a result of interacting with another group member using them\n(Burt 1987; Monge and Contractor 2003; Carley 1986; Coleman 1988). As a\nresult, the association becomes shared and thus becomes part of local group\u2019s\nknowledge. For example, if A introduces the idea of monitoring water levels at\nthe local river to B, who is unfamiliar with this idea, B may adopt the associa-\ntion between existing signs \u2018water-level\u2019 - \u2018monitoring\u2019 from A, that as a result\nbecomes part of group knowledge. Knowledge transformation may also happen\n19",
        "91a53d14-31d2-429e-b24c-baa73adc7de3": "when there emerges a new problem not captured by previously existing group\nknowledge (e.g. \ufb02ood water cannot be eliminated with a pump) requiring recom-\nbination of existing signs (Bolton 1981; Hollander & Gordon 2006; Etzrodt 2008).\nRe\ufb02ecting on existing approaches to the problem, actor A can come up with an\nidea of a better \ufb02ood protection device combining existing devices in a novel way\n(e.g., a physical barrier combined with a pump that automatically removes water).\nThe new idea would reveal itself in a recombination of corresponding signs and\nemergence of a new association \u2018barrier\u2019 - \u2018pump\u2019. Actor B may support the new\nidea and adopt the association between signs \u2018barrier\u2019- \u2018pump\u2019. Structurally this\nwill be represented as an unstable four-cycle in Figure 10. B may adopt the new\nassociation and dismiss the old one - between \u2018water\u2019 and \u2018pump\u2019 (the four-cycle)\n- in favour of the socially aligned Figure 9. This recombination would suggest a\npositive effect for TriangleXAC and a negative effect for C4AXB.\n3.2.2 Knowledge reproduction and transformation at extra-dyadic level\nAt the extra-dyadic level, transformation of knowledge may occur through the\nmechanism of preferential attachment, when actors \u2018frame\u2019 an element of shared\nknowledge by adopting associations with signs that already have general, often\nemotionally charged meanings (Schultz et al., 2012; Snow et al., 1986), rather\nthan with signs that denote more speci\ufb01c meanings. Signs used for \u2018framing\u2019 usu-\nally have many shared associations with other signs because of their generality\nor abstractness that allows them to enter many different contexts. For instance,\nactor A may argue that the group should adopt a prevention approach to \u2018\ufb02uvial\u2019\n\ufb02oods (that is, \ufb02oods caused by excessive water in a river). The new association\nbetween existing signs used by A, e.g., \u2018\ufb02ood prevention\u2019, invokes the \u2018preven-\ntion\u2019 frame that is known for actors in group Vfrom other contexts like health or\nroad safety. Therefore, the association \u2018\ufb02ood\u2019- \u2018prevention\u2019 is likely to be adopted\nby another group member, B (and hence, become part of group knowledge), un-\nlike a more specialized association \u2018\ufb02uvial \ufb02oods\u2019 that does not involve any frame\npreviously known to member B. A combination of con\ufb01gurations that is consis-\ntent with this preferential attachment is not to select isolated ties {s,u}(negative\nXASB), nor are ties {s,u}selected merely because there are many pairs with s\n(negative EXTB). A concept pair {s,u}if other ties of sare reported, captured\nthrough TriangleXBX (positive), and if many socially tied individuals chose the\nsame{s,u}(positive TriangleXAX) not ties {s,v}that also include s(negative\nC4AXB).\nIn relational patterns involving three individuals, knowledge may be repro-\nduced through the mechanism of triadic pressure. A triad embodies supra-individuality\n(Simmel, 1950: 257) and downplays individuality, diminishing the power of a sin-\ngle actor to determine the outcome of the whole interaction process. Relations in\n20",
        "7141797a-9785-454e-92cc-7c60401d5bb6": "triads are \u2018less free, less independent, more constrained\u2019 than in dyads (Krack-\nhardt, 1999: 185). In addition, actors need \u2018social af\ufb01rmation or reinforcement\nfrom multiple sources [ ...] since contact with a single active neighbour is not\nenough to trigger adoption\u2019 (Centola and Macy, 2007: 705; see also the elaborate\ndifferent forms of exposure discussed in e.g. Strang and Tuma, 1993, and related\nwork). Therefore, in triads, reproduction of existing shared knowledge is more ef-\n\ufb01cient than in a dyad (Krackhardt, 1999): if in a triad two interacting individuals\nA and B share associations between signs e.g., \u2018\ufb02ood\u2019 - \u2018management\u2019, the third\nindividual C interacting with both is likely to start sharing these associations as\nwell. This effect is over and above dyadic contagion, so that the propensity of the\nthird individual to share a sign or an association is higher than if he or she was\nsubjected to contagion by two alters who are not socially tied with each other. This\ntriadic pressure translates into the process described in Figure 11)(c) as a positive\neffect for TriangleXAX (Figure 9) and a negative effect for EXTA Figure 11(a).\n3.2.3 Entrainment with normative knowledge\nThe associations between signs in the local knowledge are affected not only by\nsocial relationships between actors but also by expert knowledge imposed on the\n\ufb02ood management groups by authorities, that is the normative relations between\nsigns indicated by G. The in\ufb02uence of expert knowledge on local knowledge\noccurs through several mechanisms that re\ufb02ect structural changes in Zconditional\non the structure of G. Basov and Brennecke (2017) perform a multiplex analysis\nwhere an aggregate local knowledge network Zis compared to the criterion graph\nG\nThere are a number of ways in which we can extend the multiplex depen-\ndencies of ZonG, to dependencies of HonG, and examine theoretically-derived\nmechanisms of expert knowledge in\ufb02uence on local knowledge, e.g. such as those\nthat result in alignment in Figure 12 and the two forms of closure in Figure 13 and\nFigure 14. We include a basic entrainment corresponding to a mechanism we call\n\u2018basic reproduction\u2019. It occurs when a local group starts associating preexisting\nsigns in the same way they are associated by the experts. For example, experts can\ntalk about \u2018rivers\u2019 as sources of \ufb02ood risks while locals may not associate \u2018river\u2019\nwith \u2018risk\u2019 at all. Locals may realise that the experts\u2019 way of thinking about the\nriver as a source of risks could be useful for them, e.g., to discuss the problem of\n\ufb02ooding with authorities.\nHence, following the experts, they start associating \u2018river\u2019 and \u2018risk\u2019.The mech-\nanism is modelled using the effect Expert XEdgeB corresponding to the con\ufb01gu-\nration in Figure 12.\nTo control for the possibility that some concept pairs in Gmay be salient only\nbecause they involve signs sthat are part of many other concept pairs, we include\n21",

This\nstatistic corresponds to a mechanism we call \u2018popularity pressure\u2019 that describes\na situation when a local group starts associating signs that are part of many other\nassociations in the experts\u2019 knowledge. For example, speaking about \ufb02ood risk\nmanagement, experts may pay signi\ufb01cant attention to communities\u2019 resilience to\n\ufb02ood hazards and highlight the importance of creating \ufb02ood plans to ensure all\nstakeholders are prepared for potential \ufb02oods. Because a local group observes the\nsigns \u2018resilience\u2019 and \u2018plan\u2019 as focal for experts, they also start associating these\ntwo signs when speaking about a local document they produce to be prepared for\n\ufb02oods - a local group \u2018resilience plan\u2019.\n3.3 Results\nThe results for two models are presented in Tables 1. For Model 1, the social\nnetwork abides by standard social processes judging by the one-mode effects\n(Snijders et al., 2006; Lusher et al., 2013), with no heterogeneity in popular-\nity (insigni\ufb01cant ASA) but with evidence for triadic closure (positive ATA or\nGWESP). The bipartite network is modelled using the three terms XEdge, XASA,\nand XACA. We will interpret these in relation to the multilevel statistics making\nup the rest of the table.\nIn terms of reproduction and transformation of knowledge, the effects go\nlargely in the direction of the predictions. The positive TriangleXAC is consis-\ntent with basic contagion or selection. The positive effect, in Model1, for Tri-\nangleXAC and a negative effect for C4AXB is consistent with recombination of\nconcept pairs.\nThe combination of negative EXTB, positive TriangleXAX, and negative C4AXB,\nis consistent with the framing operating through preferential attachment.\nAmongst the other effects, XACA and TriangleXBX capture a general coher-\nence of the local knowledge structure, connecting concept pairs that are not so-\ncially mediated. XEdge, Star2BX, StarAB1X take into account that not all signs\nare equally represented in E. The statistics Star2BX, L3XBX, and L3AXB also\nact as lower-order interactions to C4AXB.\nIntroducing G, we see that there is a signi\ufb01cant alignment of the individual\nsemantic networks and the expert network (Expert XEdge). We also see that the\ndependence on Gcompletely moderates the effect of C4AXB. This means that\nsome of the recombination and preferential attachment is explained by how con-\ncept pairs are related in the expert network. Network-related contagion (Trian-\ngleXAX) and local knowledge structure (XACA) are however not affected by the\nreliance on the expert network.\nThe effect EXTA necessary for inferring triadic pressure is not estimable from\nthis dataset and while the model predicts more con\ufb01gurations EXTA than ob-\n22",

The approach rests on transforming the original data into\na multilevel network (Lazega et al., 2008) representation. We have discussed the\nmultilevel representation in terms of meaningful, multilevel network con\ufb01gura-\ntions that are amenable to empirical investigation using multilevel ERGM (Wang\net al., 2013). The representation is however agnostic to the actual analysis method\n24",
        "c3d7a198-286d-43da-b39c-d8d26d7b551b": "and in the proposed format, networks of networks are amenable to investigation in\nany analysis framework for multilevel networks, such as stochastic actor-oriented\nmodels (Hollway et al., 2017) and blockmodels (\u017dibena and Lazega, 2016).\nOur analysis of individual semantic structures amongst 15 actors in a local\n\ufb02ood management groups provides evidence of a variety of mechanisms for so-\ncially constructed local knowledge. Some social mechanisms are moderated by\nthe introduction of an external criterion network representing a semantic network\nof \ufb02ood management experts. So, while local actors speak about their reality us-\ning their own, partially socially constructed, knowledge, this knowledge is not\ncompletely independent of the \u2018objective\u2019 knowledge of experts. There is further\nheterogeneity to explore. This may be addressed by developing more elaborate\nmultiplex associations between the individual semantic networks and the expert\nnetwork. We may also elaborate individual-level effects, for example using actor\nattributes. Socially dependent heterogeneity could also be explored. Here the con-\n\ufb01guration Star2AX captures the association between social popularity and number\nof concept pairs nominated, but it does not inform us whether people agree with\ncentral people. It is not straightforward to see whether a person who is central in\nthe social network tends to be in\ufb02uential. Future research could study the depen-\ndence of the overall structure on particular actors, something that would require\nmultilevel elaborations of outlier diagnostics (Koskinen et al., 2018).\nThe translation of data from the original domain into the multilevel represen-\ntation is not dependent on the speci\ufb01c content of the network data and we have\nsuggested how the approach might be applied in other contexts. Examples in-\nclude sociosemantic networks (Basov, 2020), socioecological networks (Bodin et\nal., 2016), and sociomaterial networks (Contractor et al., 2011; Basov, 2018),\nall of which are explicitly multilevel. Other examples include data collection\nparadigms that assume repeated observations on networks such as multiplex net-\nworks and cognitive social structures. Yet another class would be networks that\ncould be repeatedly observed for units (e.g. intersectional \ufb02ows in different coun-\ntries, Leoncini et al., 1996; and, symptom networks, Borsboom and Cramer, 2013)\nwhere work has already been done on analysing the networks of these units (so-\ncial networks in psychiatry, Moreno, 1934; and, economic ties between countries,\nSquartini et al., 2011; Koskinen and Lomi, 2013). All of these different contexts\npresent unique challenges in translating data from the original domain into the\nmultilevel network of networks presented here, some of which we have discussed.\nReferences\nAntonyuk, A., Puzyreva, K., & Basov, N.
